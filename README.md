    Elevating Your RAG Experience with Intelligent Query Guidance and Expert Suggestions!

## Application Description

One of the difficulties of adopting RAG to a mass audience is lack of understanding of the underline NLP techniques required to produce good queries. With this tool, there is an AI agent that looks at the query and the results to help the user make better queries in the future. For example, If the user never used RAG before, they may ask a vague question. The agent will pick up on this and inform the user. In addition, it will provide suggestion of how to query for better results. This tool is general enough to be easy to adapt with already established RAG pipelines, in addition it is agnostic to data meaning it could be adopted to many fields.
